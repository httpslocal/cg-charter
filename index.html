      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/httpslocal/">HTTPS in Local
      Network Community Group (CG)</a> explores the manner of secure
      communication between browsers and server-capable devices in local
      network such as set-top boxes, network attached storages, etc. We propose
      that this Community Group clarify requirements for browsers and devices
      in issuing valid certificates and establishment of HTTPS and WebSocket
      connections over TLS and incubate relevant specifications of APIs and/or
      network protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work has four primary purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Improve security and privacy of communication between browsers and
        server-capable devices.</em> It is anticipated that applying TLS to
        HTTP and WebSocket connection in local network will prevent malicious
        interception and spoofing, as well as in global internet. The
        specifications will enable server-capable devices to use TLS
        certificates which can be validated successfully by browsers without
        manually adding self-signed root CA certificates, so that browsers in
        the same local network could connect to the devices via HTTP and
        WebSocket over TLS.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Enable web applications in <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts">secure contexts</a> to
        communicate with server-capable devices in local network via <a href=
        "https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org">XMLHttpRequest</a>, <a href=
        "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org">Fetch API</a>, and <a href=
        "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#network">WebSocket</a>.</em>
        If such devices cannot establish HTTPS or WebSocket connection over TLS
        with browsers, web applications in <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts">secure contexts</a> are not
        allowed to connect to them due to <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/TR/mixed-content/">mixed content</a>. The
        specifications will mitigate such restriction by enabling TLS sessions
        between browsers and devices in local network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Enable service discovery mechanisms to advertise existence of
        TLS-enabled server-capable devices.</em> In local network, a device
        identifier advertised by the service discovery may include either local
        IP address (e.g. private IPv4 address and IPv6 link-local address). or
        locally unique name (e.g. <code>foo.local</code>), however, such an
        identifier may be much less appropriate for issuing certificates. The
        specifications will provide a manner to issue suitable certificates for
        such devices in secure and robust procedures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Encourage adoption and implementation of the specification by
        browser vendors and device manufacturers.</em> The specifications
        should allow browsers to connect to server-capable devices via TLS
        without changing the current security model of web applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Given wider support and adequate stability, we plan to migrate the
      proposals generated in this Community Group to an appropriate standards
      track, for example the <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2026#section-4">IETF Standards Track</a>
      or a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities#Working">W3C
      Working Group</a>, for further contributions and formal standardization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Membership of the group is open to everybody. Upon joining the group,
      participants agree to the terms of the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="background">
      Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      By tradition, diverse kinds of connected devices have been provided
      browsers with web applications as their controller user interfaces via
      plain HTTP connections. Since such a connection usually lacks encryption
      and identity verification, the current web security model regards the
      device's origin as insecure, which prevents web applications in <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts">secure contexts</a> from
      connecting to the devices in local network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, it is necessary how to issue valid TLS certificates for the
      devices in order to ensure security and privacy of their communication
      channels and avoid <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mixed-content/">mixed
      content</a>. Issuing certificates securely would require device
      verification by the issuer and device authentication by users.
      Coordination with service discovery mechanisms might also be important.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following tasks are in scope for the work of the community group. The
      group's scope are divided into two phases. In phase 1, the group will
      focus on clarifying the network, functional, security and privacy
      requirements, and exploring adoption of existing standards to meet the
      requirements. If the group cannot find any existing standards which can
      meet the requirements, the group will develop new supplementary standards
      in phase 2.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Phase 1
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Requirements for local network architecture, in either case that the
      local network is completely isolated from the global network, or devices
      in the local network are allowed to communicate with the external
      servers, are in scope.
      </li>
      <li>Functional requirements for browsers and devices in issuing processes
      of TLS certificates for devices such as generating Certificate Signing
      Request (CSR), validating devices by a certificate issuer, with control
      by web applications running on browsers in the same local network, are in
      scope.
      </li>
      <li>Security and privacy requirements for browsers and devices in
      issuing, reissuing and revoking TLS certificates for devices are in
      scope, in terms of device authentication bybrowsers, host and domain name
      management for devices, and device validation by a certificate issuer.
      </li>
      <li>Discussion on a privacy concern for device's host and domain name
      resolution in local network is also in scope.
      </li>
      <li>Collecting typical use cases of communication with devices in local
      network is also in scope, for the purpose of clarifying the above
      requirements.
      </li>
      <li>Clarifying issues suggested by the above requirements and surveying
      existing standards to be potential solutions for them are in scope.
      </li>
      <li>Gap analysis toward <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-04">Automatic
      Certificate Management Environment (ACME)</a> is also in scope.
      </li>
      <li>Gap analysis toward <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/">Web
      Authentication (WebAuthn)</a> is also in scope.
      </li>
      <li>Use of wireless connections such as Bluetooth and NFC is also in
      scope, in terms of device authentication and certificate issuing control
      by browsers.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      Phase 2
    </h3>
    <p>
      The following specification may be developed in phase 2, <em>only if</em>
      it is found that any existing standards cannot be adopted to meet the
      requirements discussed in phase 1.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Specifications of a set of network protocols that allows devices in
      local network to request a certificate issuer for device validation and
      issuing, reissuing and revoking TLS certificates.
      </li>
      <li>Specifications of a set of network protocols and possibly APIs that
      allows browsers to authenticate devices in the same local network, and
      let the devices communicate with a certificate issuer in order to issue,
      reissue and revoke valid TLS certificates.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      For this community group, the following tasks are out of scope.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extending interface definitions of <a href=
      "https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org">XMLHttpRequest</a>, <a href=
      "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org">Fetch API</a>, and <a href=
      "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#network">WebSocket</a>
      are out of scope.
      </li>
      <li>Developing specifications of Browser API for service discovery such
      as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/discovery-api/">Network Service
      Discovery</a> is out of scope. The group assumes that browser's user
      interface provides users with service discovery.
      </li>
      <li>Investigating use of self-signed root CA certificates without
      appropriate validation is out of scope.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="deliverables">
      Deliverables
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>The group will only produce Specifications listed in this section
      at most</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Community Group will deliver specifications designed to meet
      functional and security requirements of adopting TLS for communication
      between browsers and server-capable devices, which will be discussed in
      this group, <em>only if</em> the group cannot find any existing standards
      to meet the requirements.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The specification for a device and a certificate issuer that
      describes how the device send a CSR to the issuer, the issuer validates
      the device, and then the issuer provides the device with a valid TLS
      certificate.
      </li>
      <li>The specification for a browser and a device that describes how a
      browser authenticates a device in the same local network, let the device
      request a certificate issuer to issue, reissue and revoke a valid TLS
      certificate.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To add any additional specifications, this Charter must be amended by the
      process described in the <a href="#charter-change">Amendments to the
      Charter</a> section. All deliverables for which the CLA <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/#id3">Patents</a>

    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=

    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created in the Community Group must use the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>. All other documents produced by
      the group should use that License where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
      GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be
      in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by
      adding a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a

    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. All technical
      work will occur in its GitHub repositories (and not in mailing list
      discussions). This is to ensure contributions can be tracked through a
      software tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list and

    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. Groups
      are free to decide how to make decisions (e.g. Participants who have
      earned Committer status for a history of useful contributions assess
      consensus, or the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus isn't
      clear there is a Call for Consensus [CfC] to allow multi-day online
      feedback for a proposed course of action). It is expected that
      participants can earn Committer status through a history of valuable
      contributions as is common in open source projects. After discussion and
      due consideration of different opinions, a decision should be publicly
      recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue).
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the
      group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the
      Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with
      a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the
      choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by
      taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and
      preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation
      experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move
      ahead with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in a GitHub Issue for groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the group's
      public mail list. Any group participant may object to a decision reached
      at an online or in-person meeting within 10 days of publication of the
      decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
      objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, a process requested
      from the Community Development Lead is used to break the tie. An elected
      Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
